These memories were extracted from coding transcripts.

Follow these rules:
1. Merge duplicate or highly similar memories into a single concise fact.
2. Resolve contradictory facts, prioritizing the most recent information based on the timestamps.
3. Prefer facts about build commands, file conventions, module boundaries, dependency versions, configuration values and architectural decisions. Drop purely conversational or temporary entries.
4. Identify purely temporary or transient memories (e.g., "going to lunch", "looking for coffee") and list their indices under "discarded_ids".
5. For consolidated items, list the indices of the original memories that were merged into it in "replaces_ids".
6. Do not include any greeting, explanation, or markdown backticks in your response. Output ONLY valid JSON matching the schema below.

IMPORTANT: Use the short integer indices [1], [2], etc. shown in each memory entry — NOT the full UUIDs. The indices are 1-based.
